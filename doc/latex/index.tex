This package provides wrappers for using various persistent homology and other Topological Data Analysis software packages through python.

The code is an compilation of work done by \href{http://www.elizabethmunch.com/math}{\tt Elizabeth Munch} along with her students and collaborators. People who have contributed to teaspoon include\+:

\section*{Requirements }

Please note that this code is still pre-\/alpha, so many things are not fully up and running yet.

Bugs reports and feature reqests can be posted on the \href{https://gitlab.msu.edu/TSAwithTDA/teaspoon/issues}{\tt gitlab issues} page.

In order to use all wrappers in teaspoon.\+T\+DA, the following need to be installed so they can be run command line.

\item \href{https://github.com/Ripser/ripser}{\tt Ripser}. Code by Ulrich Bauer for computing persistent homology of a point cloud or distance matrix.
\item \href{http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html}{\tt Perseus}. Code by Vidit Nanda for computing persistent homology of point clouds, cubical complexes, and distance matrices.
\item \href{https://bitbucket.org/grey_narn/hera}{\tt Hera}. Code by Michael Kerber, Dmitriy Morozov, and Arnur Nigmetov for computing bottleneck and Wasserstein distances.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Warning\+: the teaspoon installation will not install nor check for the install of these packages. In particular, perseus should be installed so that typing {\ttfamily perseus} in a terminal runs it, even though the default perseus installation for some operating systems ends up with an executable with a different name.

\section*{Installation }

\subsubsection*{Warning\+:}

This code is still pre-\/alpha. In particular, using the pip install seems to be finicky at best. If you are having installation issues, please make a note of what you\textquotesingle{}ve done, including copying error message outputs, as a comment into the \href{https://gitlab.msu.edu/TSAwithTDA/teaspoon/issues/1}{\tt installation issue on gitlab} so we can start figuring out what is up with this system.

\subsubsection*{Installing using pip\+:}

So far, the most success has been had with pip installation. Run the following commands to clone and install teaspoon. In particular, the {\ttfamily pip install .} command needs to be run in the folder with the {\ttfamily setup.\+py} file.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone https://gitlab.msu.edu/TSAwithTDA/teaspoon
2 cd teaspoon
3 pip install .
\end{DoxyCode}


If you already have teaspoon installed but want to update to a newer version, run the following from the teaspoon folder. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 pip install -U .
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Installing using python\+:}

According to the internet, the pip version of install appears to be better. However, if you don\textquotesingle{}t use pip, another option is to cd into the teaspoon directory and run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 python setup.py install
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Alternatively, just add the folder to the python path.}

If the above aren\textquotesingle{}t working, add the following line to your {\ttfamily .bashrc} file. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 export PYTHONPATH="$\{PYTHONPATH\}:/path/to/teaspoon
\end{DoxyCode}

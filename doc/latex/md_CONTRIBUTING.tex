While I\textquotesingle{}m sure this workflow will change as we go, here are some links to get you started.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A nice introduction to git\+: \href{http://gitimmersion.com/}{\tt Git Immersion}
\item Other packages to install in order to get full functionality out of teaspoon\+:

\item \href{https://github.com/Ripser/ripser}{\tt Ripser}. Code by Ulrich Bauer for computing persistent homology of a point cloud or distance matrix.
\item \href{http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html}{\tt Perseus}. Code by Vidit Nanda for computing persistent homology of point clouds, cubical complexes, and distance matrices.
\item \href{https://bitbucket.org/grey_narn/hera}{\tt Hera}. Code by Michael Kerber, Dmitriy Morozov, and Arnur Nigmetov for computing bottleneck and Wasserstein distances.

\section*{Basic workflow}

When you\textquotesingle{}re going to start messing with something, create a branch for it. This will likely just be done on your local machine. When you think it\textquotesingle{}s ready to be merged into the master branch, go to the merge request page on gilab and submit your merge request.

Disscussions, comments, and updates can be done on the gitlab merge request page.

\section*{Documentation}

Automatic documentation is being done with \href{www.doxygen.org}{\tt doxygen}. Info to get you started is available in their \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html}{\tt manual}. The config file here is {\ttfamily Doxyfile} in the top level of the folder. So, compiling the documentation should be as easy as running 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 doxygen /path/to/Doxyfile
\end{DoxyCode}
 Compiled documentation goes into the {\ttfamily doc} folder. Point your browser to {\ttfamily doc/html/index.\+html} to see the result. Don\textquotesingle{}t forget to refresh your brower after you compile the documentation since most browsers won\textquotesingle{}t automatically update the page for you.

\section*{Before you push}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Have you run doxygen to update the documentation?
\item Have you incremented the version number?
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Questions, comments, and other issues}

...should be sent to \href{mailto:muncheli@msu.edu}{\tt Liz Munch}.

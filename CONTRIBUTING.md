While I'm sure this workflow will change as we go, here are some links to get you started.

- A nice introduction to git: [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
- Other packages to install in order to get full functionality out of teaspoon:
    - [Ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser). Code by Ulrich Bauer for computing persistent homology of a point cloud or distance matrix.
    - [Perseus](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html). Code by Vidit Nanda for computing persistent homology of point clouds, cubical complexes, and distance matrices.
    - [Hera](https://bitbucket.org/grey_narn/hera). Code by Michael Kerber, Dmitriy Morozov, and Arnur Nigmetov for computing bottleneck and Wasserstein distances.
- Please put issues in the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.msu.edu/TSAwithTDA/teaspoon/issues)
